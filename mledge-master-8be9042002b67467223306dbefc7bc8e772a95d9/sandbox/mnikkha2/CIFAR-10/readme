You can change the code to generate images only from one class. Right now the code is generating only cat images, because we set "if tempLabel[i]==3:" in the loop where we read the images. The different CIFAR-10 classes are listed below:

0: Airplane
1: Automobile (excluding Trucks)
2: Bird
3: Cat
4: Deer
5: Dog
6: Frog
7: Horse 
8: Ship
9: Truck
